## Comments

-   Remember to use a large pan for 1kg or larger meatloaves or else the loaf won’t cook evenly. The center will take much longer to get to temperature. 
-   I would have adapted this recipe from Dad. I would have added Worcestershire, Garlic Powder, and Jalapenos. Dad would have used more ketchup.
-   Use parchment paper (with handles) on the bottom of the pan so that you can easily lift the loaf out; otherwise, I end up breaking the loaf into pieces.
