I remember my grandmother (Nana) would have numerous books. They were easy for her to navigate, but not for me. I am hoping this can easily be used by anyone to see which recipes I liked. I'll include a five star rating, ingredients, instructions, nutritional value, personal origins, and pictures.

This main page will be a glossary for the subordinate recipe pages. I will using headings as tags
